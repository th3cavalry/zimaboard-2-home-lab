# Lancache DNS Resolution Fix

## Issue Summary

**Bug Report**: [BUB] Lancache is not working as expected

**Problem**: DNS queries for `steamcontent.com` returned "no answer", while blocked domains like `doubleclick.net` correctly resolved to `0.0.0.0`. This prevented Lancache from functioning properly.

**Root Cause**: The AdGuard Home DNS rewrites were configured only with wildcard patterns (e.g., `*.steamcontent.com`) which do NOT match the base domain itself (`steamcontent.com`). This is a fundamental behavior of DNS wildcard patterns.

## Technical Details

### DNS Wildcard Pattern Behavior

In DNS, a wildcard pattern like `*.steamcontent.com` matches:
- ‚úÖ `cdn.steamcontent.com`
- ‚úÖ `content1.steamcontent.com`
- ‚úÖ `any-subdomain.steamcontent.com`
- ‚ùå `steamcontent.com` (the base domain itself)

This is by design in DNS specifications. To match both the base domain and all subdomains, you need **two separate entries**:
1. `steamcontent.com` ‚Üí resolves the base domain
2. `*.steamcontent.com` ‚Üí resolves all subdomains

### Previous Configuration

Before the fix, `AdGuardHome.yaml` only had wildcard entries:

```yaml
rewrites:
  - domain: "*.steamcontent.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  - domain: "*.download.epicgames.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  # ... (only wildcard patterns)
```

**Result**: Queries for `steamcontent.com` returned "no answer" ‚ùå

### Fixed Configuration

After the fix, both base domains and wildcard patterns are configured:

```yaml
rewrites:
  # Steam Content Delivery
  - domain: "steamcontent.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  - domain: "*.steamcontent.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  
  # Epic Games Downloads
  - domain: "download.epicgames.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  - domain: "*.download.epicgames.com"
    answer: "192.168.8.2"
  # ... (total: 14 rewrites = 7 base + 7 wildcard)
```

**Result**: Queries for both `steamcontent.com` and `cdn.steamcontent.com` resolve correctly ‚úÖ

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AdGuardHome.yaml Configuration

**File**: `configs/adguardhome/AdGuardHome.yaml`

**Changes**:
- Added 7 new DNS rewrite entries for base domains
- Total DNS rewrites increased from 7 to 14
- Added explanatory comments about wildcard behavior
- Updated documentation section in the file

**Services Fixed** (7 total):
1. Steam: `steamcontent.com` + `*.steamcontent.com`
2. Epic Games: `download.epicgames.com` + `*.download.epicgames.com`
3. Origin (EA): `origin.com` + `*.origin.com`
4. Xbox Live: `xboxlive.com` + `*.xboxlive.com`
5. PlayStation Network: `playstation.net` + `*.playstation.net`
6. Battle.net (Blizzard): `blizzard.com` + `*.blizzard.com`
7. Windows Update: `windowsupdate.com` + `*.windowsupdate.com`

### 2. Created DNS Test Script

**File**: `scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh` (new file, 144 lines)

**Features**:
- Automated testing of all 14 DNS rewrites
- Tests both base domains and wildcard subdomains
- Color-coded output for easy reading
- Clear pass/fail reporting
- Detailed troubleshooting suggestions on failure
- Supports custom DNS server IP as argument

**Usage**:
```bash
bash scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh 192.168.8.2
```

**Example Output**:
```
========================================
Lancache DNS Resolution Test
========================================

Testing DNS server: 192.168.8.2

Testing DNS Resolution:

Testing: steamcontent.com
  ‚úì PASS - Resolved to 192.168.8.2
Testing: cdn.steamcontent.com
  ‚úì PASS - Resolved to 192.168.8.2
...

========================================
Test Summary
========================================
Total tests:  14
Passed:       14
Failed:       0

‚úÖ All tests passed! Lancache DNS is configured correctly.
```

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

**File**: `README.md`

**Changes**:
- Updated Pre-Configured Services table to show both base and wildcard patterns
- Added note explaining wildcard behavior
- Added automated test script instructions as recommended verification method
- Enhanced Lancache troubleshooting section with DNS diagnostics
- Updated rewrite count from 7 to 14
- Added step-by-step DNS resolution testing instructions

## How to Verify the Fix

### For Existing Users

If you already have AdGuard Home running with the old configuration:

1. **Update the configuration file**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/zimaboard-2-home-lab
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Restart AdGuard Home**:
   ```bash
   # Path A (Docker):
   docker compose restart adguardhome
   
   # Path B (Bare-metal):
   sudo systemctl restart AdGuardHome
   ```

3. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh 192.168.8.2
   ```

4. **Manual verification**:
   ```bash
   # Both should now return 192.168.8.2
   nslookup steamcontent.com 192.168.8.2
   nslookup cdn.steamcontent.com 192.168.8.2
   ```

### For New Users

New users will automatically get the fixed configuration:
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in README.md
3. Run the test script after deployment to verify

## Testing Results

### Validation Performed

1. **YAML Syntax Check**: ‚úÖ PASS
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('configs/adguardhome/AdGuardHome.yaml'))"
   ```

2. **DNS Rewrite Count Verification**: ‚úÖ PASS
   - Expected: 14 rewrites (7 base + 7 wildcard)
   - Actual: 14 rewrites
   - All domains correctly configured

3. **Bash Script Syntax Check**: ‚úÖ PASS
   ```bash
   bash -n scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh
   ```

4. **Documentation Accuracy**: ‚úÖ PASS

## Lessons Learned

### DNS Wildcard Patterns
- Wildcard patterns (`*.domain.com`) do NOT match the base domain
- Always configure both base and wildcard for comprehensive coverage
- This is standard DNS behavior, not AdGuard-specific

### Configuration Validation
- Automated testing scripts catch configuration issues early
- Test scripts should verify both expected and edge cases
- Documentation should explain "why" not just "how"

### User Support
- Proactive troubleshooting guides reduce support burden
- Test scripts empower users to diagnose their own issues
- Clear explanations prevent future similar problems
