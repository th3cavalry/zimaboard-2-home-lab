# Lancache DNS Resolution - Before and After

## Problem Visualization

### Before the Fix ❌

```
User Query: "steamcontent.com"
    ↓
AdGuard Home DNS Rewrites:
    - *.steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2
    ↓
No Match! (wildcard doesn't match base domain)
    ↓
Forward to upstream DNS
    ↓
Upstream DNS: "No answer"
    ↓
User: ❌ "No answer" error
Lancache: ❌ Not used
```

```
User Query: "cdn.steamcontent.com"
    ↓
AdGuard Home DNS Rewrites:
    - *.steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2
    ↓
Match! (wildcard matches subdomain)
    ↓
Return: 192.168.8.2
    ↓
User: ✅ Gets IP
Lancache: ✅ Used for caching
```

**Result**: Inconsistent behavior - some queries work, others don't.

---

## After the Fix ✅

```
User Query: "steamcontent.com"
    ↓
AdGuard Home DNS Rewrites:
    - steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2      ← NEW!
    - *.steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2
    ↓
Match! (exact match on base domain)
    ↓
Return: 192.168.8.2
    ↓
User: ✅ Gets IP
Lancache: ✅ Used for caching
```

```
User Query: "cdn.steamcontent.com"
    ↓
AdGuard Home DNS Rewrites:
    - steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2
    - *.steamcontent.com → 192.168.8.2
    ↓
Match! (wildcard matches subdomain)
    ↓
Return: 192.168.8.2
    ↓
User: ✅ Gets IP
Lancache: ✅ Used for caching
```

**Result**: Consistent behavior - all queries work correctly!

## Configuration Comparison

### Before (7 rewrites)
```yaml
dns:
  rewrites:
    - domain: "*.steamcontent.com"        # Only wildcard
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    - domain: "*.download.epicgames.com"  # Only wildcard
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    # ... 5 more wildcard-only entries
```

### After (14 rewrites)
```yaml
dns:
  rewrites:
    # Steam - Base domain
    - domain: "steamcontent.com"          # Base domain ← NEW!
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    # Steam - Wildcard subdomains
    - domain: "*.steamcontent.com"        # Wildcard
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    
    # Epic Games - Base domain
    - domain: "download.epicgames.com"    # Base domain ← NEW!
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    # Epic Games - Wildcard subdomains
    - domain: "*.download.epicgames.com"  # Wildcard
      answer: "192.168.8.2"
    
    # ... 5 more service pairs (base + wildcard)
```

## DNS Wildcard Behavior Explained

### What Wildcards Match

Pattern: `*.steamcontent.com`

✅ **Matches**:
- `cdn.steamcontent.com`
- `content1.steamcontent.com`
- `cache.steamcontent.com`
- `any-subdomain.steamcontent.com`

❌ **Does NOT Match**:
- `steamcontent.com` (the base domain itself!)

### Why This Happens

This is standard DNS behavior according to RFC 4592. A wildcard label (`*`) only matches one or more labels that are **present**. It doesn't match zero labels, so the base domain is not matched.

### The Solution

To match both the base domain and all subdomains, you need **TWO entries**:

```yaml
- domain: "steamcontent.com"      # Matches: steamcontent.com
  answer: "192.168.8.2"
- domain: "*.steamcontent.com"    # Matches: *.steamcontent.com
  answer: "192.168.8.2"
```

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test

```bash
# Before fix:
$ nslookup steamcontent.com 192.168.8.2
Server:         192.168.8.2
Address:        192.168.8.2#53

** server can't find steamcontent.com: NXDOMAIN  ❌

# After fix:
$ nslookup steamcontent.com 192.168.8.2
Server:         192.168.8.2
Address:        192.168.8.2#53

Name:   steamcontent.com
Address: 192.168.8.2  ✅
```

### Automated Test

```bash
$ bash scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh 192.168.8.2

## Impact on Users

### Before Fix
- 🔴 DNS queries for base domains fail
- 🔴 Lancache cannot cache content from base domain URLs
- 🔴 Users see "No answer" errors
- 🔴 Inconsistent caching behavior

### After Fix
- 🟢 All DNS queries resolve correctly
- 🟢 Lancache works for all domain patterns
- 🟢 No "No answer" errors
- 🟢 Consistent, reliable caching

## Lessons for Future Configuration

### DNS Rewrite Best Practices

1. **Always configure both base and wildcard patterns** for comprehensive coverage:
   ```yaml
   - domain: "example.com"      # Base
   - domain: "*.example.com"    # Wildcard
   ```

2. **Test both patterns** after configuration:
   ```bash
   nslookup example.com YOUR_DNS_IP
   nslookup subdomain.example.com YOUR_DNS_IP
   ```

3. **Use automated tests** to verify all rewrites:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/test-lancache-dns.sh
   ```

4. **Document the "why"** not just the "what":
   - Explain DNS wildcard behavior
   - Reference RFCs when applicable
   - Help users understand the reasoning

---

## Summary

**Problem**: Wildcard DNS rewrites (`*.domain.com`) don't match base domains (`domain.com`)

**Root Cause**: Standard DNS wildcard behavior per RFC 4592

**Solution**: Configure both base domain and wildcard entries

**Implementation**: Added 7 new base domain rewrites (14 total)

**Verification**: Created automated test script to validate all rewrites

**Result**: ✅ Lancache DNS resolution now works correctly for all patterns
