# Streaming Ads Blocking - Important Information

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ABOUT STREAMING AD BLOCKING ⚠️⚠️⚠️

Blocking ads on streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Peacock, YouTube, etc.) is **EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND UNRELIABLE**. 

**Please read this document carefully before attempting to block streaming ads.**

---

## Why Streaming Ad Blocking Is So Difficult

Streaming services have evolved sophisticated methods to prevent ad blocking:

- **Same-Domain Serving**: Streaming services intentionally serve ads from the same domains as content
- **Active Countermeasures**: Services actively detect and circumvent ad blocking
- **Frequent Changes**: Ad delivery methods change constantly
- **Potential Breakage**: Blocking attempts **WILL BREAK** video playback entirely
- **App vs Browser**: Mobile apps are harder to block than web browsers
- **Limited Effectiveness**: Even with the best filters, success rates are **20-40% at best**
- **Terms of Service**: May violate service terms and risk account suspension

---

## The Reality: Service-by-Service Breakdown

Here's what to expect when attempting to block ads on popular streaming platforms:

### YouTube
- **Difficulty**: Very difficult
- **Success Rate**: 20-30%
- **Risk**: Often breaks video playback completely
- **Mobile Apps**: Nearly impossible to block

### Netflix
- **Difficulty**: Nearly impossible
- **Success Rate**: <10%
- **Risk**: Service will break entirely

### Hulu
- **Difficulty**: Extremely difficult
- **Success Rate**: <20%
- **Risk**: High breakage risk, may result in account issues

### Cable/Live TV Apps
- **Difficulty**: Almost impossible
- **Success Rate**: <5%
- **Risk**: Services will not work

### Other Streaming Services
Most modern streaming platforms (Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, etc.) use similar techniques to YouTube and Netflix, making DNS-level blocking largely ineffective.

## If You Still Want to Try (At Your Own Risk)

⚠️ **WARNING**: Following these steps may break your streaming services entirely. Proceed with caution.

### Step 1: Add Experimental Blocklists

1. Open AdGuard Home web interface (http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:3000)
2. Go to **Filters → DNS blocklists**
3. Click "Add blocklist"
4. Add these **experimental** lists one at a time:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/pro.plus.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/fake.txt
https://blocklistproject.github.io/Lists/ads.txt
```

5. Click "Save" after adding each list

### Step 2: Add Custom Filtering Rules

1. Go to **Filters → Custom filtering rules**
2. Add these regex patterns (**use with extreme caution**):

```
||doubleclick.net^
||googlesyndication.com^
||googleadservices.com^
||youtube.com/api/stats/ads^
||youtube.com/ptracking^
```

3. Click "Apply"

### Step 3: Test and Monitor

- Test streaming services immediately
- Check for broken playback or errors
- Be prepared to revert changes

## Recommended Approach Instead

Rather than attempting DNS-level streaming ad blocking (which will likely fail), consider these more effective alternatives:

### 1. Browser Extensions (Most Effective)
- **uBlock Origin** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
  - Free and open-source
  - Works well for web-based streaming
  - Regularly updated to bypass countermeasures
  - Download: https://ublockorigin.com/

- **AdGuard Browser Extension** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Good compatibility with streaming sites
  - Active development
  - Download: https://adguard.com/en/adguard-browser-extension/overview.html

### 2. Premium Subscriptions
Consider paying for ad-free tiers of services you use frequently:

- **YouTube Premium**: Ad-free YouTube + YouTube Music ($11.99/month)
- **Hulu (No Ads)**: Ad-free Hulu content ($17.99/month)
- **Peacock Premium Plus**: Ad-free Peacock ($11.99/month)

### 3. Focus DNS Blocking on What Works
Your AdGuard Home setup is excellent at blocking:

- **Website ads** (banner ads, pop-ups, etc.)
- **Tracking and analytics**
- **Malware and phishing domains**
- **Mobile app ads** (in-app advertising for free apps)
- **Smart TV ads** (some manufacturer telemetry and ads)

Focus your efforts here where DNS-level blocking is effective.

### 4. Alternative Platforms
Consider using platforms that respect user choice:

- **Odysee** (decentralized video platform)
- **Nebula** (creator-owned streaming platform)
- **Patreon** (direct creator support)

## Troubleshooting: If Streaming Services Break

If you've attempted streaming ad blocking and your services no longer work:

### Method 1: Allowlist Specific Domains

1. Open AdGuard Home web interface
2. Go to **Settings → DNS settings**
3. Scroll to "DNS allowlist"
4. Add the domain of the broken service:
   ```
   netflix.com
   youtube.com
   hulu.com
   ```
5. Click "Save"

### Method 2: Temporarily Disable AdGuard Home

**For Path A (Docker):**
```bash
# Temporary disable
docker compose stop adguardhome

# Re-enable when done
docker compose start adguardhome
```

**For Path B (Bare-Metal):**
```bash
# Temporary disable
sudo systemctl stop AdGuardHome

# Re-enable when done
sudo systemctl start AdGuardHome
```

### Method 3: Bypass AdGuard Home for Specific Devices

Configure the device's network settings to use a different DNS server:

- **Primary DNS**: 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)
- **Secondary DNS**: 8.8.8.8 (Google)

This will bypass AdGuard Home for that device only.

### Method 4: Remove Custom Rules

1. Go to **Filters → Custom filtering rules**
2. Remove or comment out (add `!` at start) problematic rules
3. Click "Apply"

### Method 5: Disable Experimental Blocklists

1. Go to **Filters → DNS blocklists**
2. Uncheck the experimental lists you added
3. Click "Save"

## Important Reminders

- DNS-level ad blocking is **not a magic solution** for streaming ads
- Streaming services are **actively fighting** ad blockers
- What works today may **break tomorrow**
- Your mileage **will vary**
- When in doubt, **don't block** - it's better to have working services

---

## Questions or Issues?

If you're experiencing problems with streaming services:

1. **First**: Try the troubleshooting steps above
2. **Check**: AdGuard Home logs for blocked queries
3. **Test**: Temporarily disable AdGuard Home to confirm it's the cause
4. **Consider**: Whether ad-free streaming is worth the hassle

Remember: **DNS-level blocking cannot reliably block streaming ads without breaking services.**
