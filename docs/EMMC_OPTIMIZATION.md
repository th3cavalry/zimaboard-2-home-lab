# eMMC Storage Optimization for Proxmox VE

This document describes the eMMC optimization strategies implemented for the ZimaBoard homelab to maximize the lifespan of the embedded eMMC storage while maintaining good performance.

## Overview

eMMC (embedded MultiMediaCard) storage has limited write cycles compared to traditional hard drives. To maximize its lifespan when running Proxmox VE, we implement several optimization strategies to reduce unnecessary writes while maintaining system performance.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Filesystem Mount Options

**Mount Options Applied:**
- `noatime`: Disables access time updates on file reads
- `commit=600`: Increases journal commit interval to 10 minutes (from default 5 seconds)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces write operations for file access tracking
- Batches filesystem journal writes
- Significant reduction in unnecessary I/O operations

### 2. TRIM Configuration

**Implementation:**
- **Periodic TRIM**: Enabled via systemd timer (weekly)
- **Continuous TRIM disabled**: Avoids constant TRIM operations that can cause system freezes

**Benefits:**
- Allows SSD controller to reclaim unused blocks efficiently
- Prevents performance degradation over time
- Reduces write amplification

### 3. Temporary Directory Optimization

**tmpfs Configuration:**
- `/tmp`: 1GB tmpfs (RAM-based storage)
- `/var/tmp`: 512MB tmpfs
- `noatime,nosuid` options for security and performance

**Benefits:**
- Temporary files never hit eMMC storage
- Faster temporary file operations
- Automatic cleanup on reboot

### 4. System Journal Optimization

**Journal Settings:**
- Maximum system journal size: 200MB
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Compression enabled
- Sync interval: 5 minutes (vs. immediate)
- Log level reduced to warnings only

**Benefits:**
- Limits journal size growth
- Reduces frequent write operations
- Maintains essential logging while reducing verbosity

### 5. Kernel Parameter Tuning

**Memory Management:**
- `vm.swappiness=1`: Minimal swap usage (was 60)
- `vm.dirty_expire_centisecs=6000`: 60-second dirty page timeout
- `vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs=12000`: 120-second writeback interval
- Increased dirty memory ratios for better batching

**Benefits:**
- Reduces swap usage (critical for eMMC longevity)
- Batches write operations for efficiency
- Better memory utilization

### 6. I/O Scheduler Optimization

**Scheduler Configuration:**
- `deadline` scheduler for SSD/eMMC devices
- Reduced queue depth for eMMC (8 vs. default 32)
- Automatic detection via udev rules

**Benefits:**
- Optimized for flash storage characteristics
- Reduced latency for small operations
- Better performance for mixed workloads

### 7. Log Rotation Enhancement

**Aggressive Log Rotation:**
- Daily rotation for most logs
- 7-day retention for general logs
- 3-day retention for system logs
- Compression enabled

**Benefits:**
- Prevents log directory growth
- Reduces long-term storage usage
- Maintains debugging capability

### 8. Memory Compression (zswap)

**zswap Configuration:**
- LZ4 compression algorithm
- 20% of RAM allocated to compressed memory pool
- Trades CPU cycles for reduced I/O

**Benefits:**
- Extends effective memory capacity
- Reduces swap usage significantly
- Better performance than disk swapping

### 9. Health Monitoring

**Monitoring Features:**
- Hourly health checks
- Bad block detection
- Space usage monitoring
- Health log maintenance

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of storage issues
- Proactive maintenance alerts
- Long-term health tracking

### 10. Automated Maintenance

**Monthly Maintenance Tasks:**
- Manual TRIM operations
- Package cache cleanup
- Log cleanup and rotation
- Temporary file cleanup
- Database optimization

**Benefits:**
- Prevents storage fragmentation
- Maintains optimal performance
- Reduces manual intervention

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- **Reduced Write Operations**: 60-80% reduction in unnecessary writes
- **Better Memory Utilization**: zswap can effectively double usable RAM
- **Improved Responsiveness**: Deadline scheduler optimizes for interactive workloads
- **Faster Temporary Operations**: tmpfs eliminates disk I/O for temporary files

### Considerations:
- **Increased Memory Usage**: tmpfs and reduced swappiness require adequate RAM
- **Delayed Writes**: Longer commit intervals may increase data loss risk during power failures
- **Reduced Logging**: Warning-level logging may hide some diagnostic information

## Monitoring Commands

### Check eMMC Health:
```bash
# View health log
sudo cat /var/log/emmc-health.log

# Check TRIM support
sudo lsblk --discard

# Monitor I/O operations
sudo iotop -ao
```

### View Configuration:
```bash
# Check mount options
mount | grep -E "(noatime|commit)"

# Verify I/O scheduler
cat /sys/block/*/queue/scheduler

# Check kernel parameters
sysctl vm.swappiness vm.dirty_ratio
```

### Manual Maintenance:
```bash
# Run maintenance manually
sudo /usr/local/bin/emmc-maintenance.sh

# Manual TRIM
sudo fstrim -av

# Check space usage
df -h
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Monitor storage health regularly
- Run monthly maintenance
- Keep adequate free space (>20%)
- Use external storage for bulk data
- Monitor system logs for errors

### DON'T:
- Disable all logging (security risk)
- Set swappiness to 0 (can cause OOM)
- Use continuous TRIM on problematic hardware
- Ignore health warnings
- Fill storage beyond 80% capacity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Increase RAM or reduce tmpfs sizes
   - Monitor with `free -h` and `htop`

2. **Application Errors with tmpfs**
   - Some applications may fail with limited /tmp
   - Set `TMPDIR` environment variable to disk location

3. **Delayed Writes Risk**
   - Consider UPS for power protection
   - Monitor system stability

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Check I/O patterns with `iotop`
   - Verify scheduler settings
   - Monitor swap usage
