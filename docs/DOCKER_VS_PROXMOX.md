## Overview

This document compares two deployment approaches for your ZimaBoard 2 security homelab: Docker Compose (containerized) vs Proxmox VE (virtualized).

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Docker Compose | Proxmox VE |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Resource Overhead** | Low | Medium |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | VM/Container-level |
| **Management** | Command-line + Web UIs | Comprehensive Web UI |
| **Backup** | Manual/Scripts | Built-in snapshots |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Excellent |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Moderate |
| **Hardware Requirements** | Minimal | Moderate |

## Docker Compose Approach

3. **Quick Setup**: Ready to run in minutes
4. **Resource Efficient**: Minimal memory/CPU overhead
5. **Easy Updates**: Simple container image updates
6. **Familiar**: Most developers know Docker
7. **Portable**: Configurations work across different hosts

### ❌ Disadvantages

1. **Limited Isolation**: All containers share the same kernel
2. **Single Point of Failure**: Host OS issues affect all services
3. **Resource Contention**: Services compete for host resources
4. **Backup Complexity**: Need custom backup scripts
5. **Monitoring**: Requires additional monitoring setup
6. **Scaling**: Limited to single host

### Best For

## Performance Comparison

### Network Performance

**Docker**: 
- Native host networking performance
- Lower latency between containers
- Shared network stack

**Proxmox**:
- Slight virtualization overhead (~5-10%)
- Better traffic isolation
- Advanced networking features (VLANs, bridges)

### Storage Performance

**Docker**:
- Direct host filesystem access
- Shared storage pools
- Simple volume management

**Proxmox**:
- Storage virtualization overhead
- Advanced features (snapshots, replication)
- Multiple storage backends (ZFS, LVM, Ceph)

### Memory Efficiency

**Docker**:
- Shared libraries and kernel
- Page sharing between containers
- Lower memory overhead

- Additional management overhead

## Migration Path

### Start with Docker, Migrate to Proxmox

```bash
# Phase 1: Deploy Docker setup (Week 1)
./scripts/install/install.sh

# Phase 2: Learn and test (Week 2-4)
# Use Docker setup while learning Proxmox

# Phase 3: Install Proxmox (Week 5)
# Install Proxmox on separate storage
# Keep Docker running during transition

# Phase 4: Migrate services (Week 6-8)
./scripts/proxmox-deploy.sh
# Migrate data from Docker volumes to Proxmox VMs/containers

# Phase 5: Full cutover (Week 9)
# Switch DNS and networking to Proxmox setup
# Decommission Docker setup
```

## Recommendations

### Choose Docker Compose If:

- ✅ New to homelabbing
- ✅ Want quick setup and minimal complexity
- ✅ Have limited time for maintenance
- ✅ Primarily focused on the security services
- ✅ Don't plan major expansion
- ✅ Comfortable with command-line management

### Choose Proxmox VE If:

- ✅ Want to learn virtualization
- ✅ Plan to add more services later
- ✅ Need professional-grade features
- ✅ Want better resource isolation
- ✅ Prefer web-based management
- ✅ Need built-in backup and recovery
- ✅ Plan to cluster or scale out

## Hybrid Approach

You can also run both:

1. **Proxmox as host** with Docker inside VMs
2. **Start with Docker**, migrate to Proxmox later
3. **Use Docker for development**, Proxmox for production

## Cost Analysis

### Time Investment

**Docker Compose**:
- Initial setup: 2-4 hours
- Learning curve: 1-2 days
- Ongoing maintenance: 1-2 hours/week

**Proxmox VE**:
- Initial setup: 4-8 hours
- Learning curve: 1-2 weeks
- Ongoing maintenance: 2-3 hours/week

### Hardware Efficiency

**Docker**: Better for resource-constrained setups
**Proxmox**: Better for utilizing full hardware potential

### Future-Proofing

**Docker**: Good for current needs, limited expansion
**Proxmox**: Excellent for growth and professional development

## Conclusion

Both approaches work well for the ZimaBoard 2 homelab:

- **Start with Docker** if you want to get up and running quickly
- **Go with Proxmox** if you want a professional-grade setup
- **Consider your goals**: Learning vs. quick deployment
- **Think long-term**: Will you expand this homelab?

The beauty of this project is that you can start with either approach and migrate later if needed!
