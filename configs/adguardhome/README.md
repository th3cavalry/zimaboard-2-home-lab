# AdGuard Home Configuration

This directory contains the configuration files for AdGuard Home.

When you first start AdGuard Home, it will generate its configuration files here automatically during the initial setup wizard.

## Files Generated
- `AdGuardHome.yaml` - Main configuration file
- Other runtime files as needed

## Manual Configuration
